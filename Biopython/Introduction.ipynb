    "#### In this project, we will examine the structure of proteins in PDB (Protein Data Bank) files using the biopython libraray. We will examine the structure of a PDB file, use biopython to load PDB files as well as extract information and visualize the extracted information. We have obtained protein structructral data from the Protein Data Bank website at https://www.rcsb.org/ which provide free access to protein crystal structures. We have moved the downloaded file into the folder with this Jupyter notebook."

    "#### The PDB ( Protein Data Bank) file format is widely used in the field of structural biology to represent the three-dimensional structures of proteins, nucleic acids, and complex molecular assemblies. While some other bioinformatics file formats online include mainly sequence data, the PDB file format provides an assortment of information which include amino acid sequence, information about helix, information about secondary structures to generate visual representations of proteins, xyz coordinates of atoms identified in structure (does not typically include hydrogens), metadata about the protein, etc. PDB files are text files with the data arranged with specific labels and seperated by strictly-delineated position in a line in the file."

We will use the `get_structure()` which returns a structure object that contains information about the protein structure contained in the PDB file. `PDBParser().get_structure()` function requires two need two arguments. The first one is 'name', which is a string through which we can give name to the structure that will be created from the PDB file and second one is 'fine_name.pdb' which is a name of the PDB file which we are extracting.\n",

    "#### We have organized the structural data extracted from the PDB in a hierachy starting with structure &rarr; model  &rarr; chain  &rarr; residue &rarr; atom. Structure refers to the 3D structure of a protein, which can be composed of one or two model, the chain represent the individual peptide chains in the protein, the residue is an amino acid residue in the chain, the residue is composition of several atoms and the atom is each atom within a given chain. By breaking down the complex structure, it is easier to understand the relationships between different parts of a protein structure and to perform more complex analyses. It also help us to undrestand and analyze the complex 3D structures of protein and other biological maromolecules. "
